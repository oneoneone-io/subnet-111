    """
    A synapse for handling Google Maps reviews data between validators and miners.
    This protocol facilitates communication for Google Maps review-related tasks.

    Request Flow:
    1. Validator creates synapse with fid and parameters
    2. Miner receives synapse and fetches reviews from Google Maps
    3. Miner populates reviews field and returns synapse
    4. Validator scores the response

    Attributes:
    - fid: Google Maps place identifier (FID) to fetch reviews for
    - placeId: Google Maps place identifier (Place ID) to fetch reviews for
    - language: Language code for reviews (e.g., "en", "es", "fr")
    - sort: Sort order for reviews ("newest", "relevant", "highest", "lowest")
    - timeout: Timeout for the request in seconds
    - reviews: List of review data returned by the miner (filled by miner)
